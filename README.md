**Bengaluru House Price Prediction**

📌 **Overview**

This project builds a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Bengaluru based on various factors like location, area, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The model is deployed using Flask with an interactive web interface.

🚀 **Features**

* Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

* Feature Engineering: Location encoding, dimensionality reduction.

* Machine Learning Model: Trained using Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).

* Web App: Built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time predictions.

* Data Visualization: Insights generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🔧 **Tech Stack**

* Programming: Python

* Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

* Web Framework: Flask

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Dataset**

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains location, area, BHK, price per square foot, and other features.

Data preprocessing included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and feature scaling.

📌**Results & Insights**

The model achieved 86.29% accuracy on the test set.

Price variations across different locations were visualized using heatmaps & scatter plots.
